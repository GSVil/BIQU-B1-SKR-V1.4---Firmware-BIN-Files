# BIQU-B1-SKR-V1.4---Firmware-BIN-Files
Latest Firmware Builds for BIQU B1, board SKR V1.4

For those interested in downloading the working firmware, I have uploaded my BIN file. It took me almost a week to get it working correctly, recompiling and testing multiple versions of MARLIN before eventually settling on Marlin 2.1.2.5. I believe this should work great for everyone, but please let me know if something is not working or needs adjusting.
